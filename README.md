## Dependencies
    
    sudo apt install build-essential libboost-locale-dev libboost-serialization-dev \
        libboost-thread-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev \
        libboost-regex-dev libssl-dev

The Netspeak operators are commented out for now, since they need the Netspeak C++
libraries and a local version of the index (not included in this repository).

## Compilation

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make [-j8]

## Customization

As of now, the search configuration is done in-code. You can find which operators
are being applied at which individual path costs in `obfuscation/Obfuscator.cpp`.
